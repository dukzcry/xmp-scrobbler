xmp-scrobbler is a Last.fm submission plugin for XMPlay. Since original developer 'yagood' stoped this project, the new guy called 'Xander' brake into to keep project alive. Still he hasn't done any real innovative features, he fixed long-stayed cache corruption problem. Right before i started xmp-scrobbler++ project that will add some new real innovations, but sources will never be published due my decision, yes it will violates original GPL license, but yep, i'm a law breaker pirate bwahaha.

Current permanent feature realized in xmp-scrobbler++ is radio streams submissions. Next permanent stages will be moving to 1.2+ protocol and adding of some integration with original Last.fm application. 
Though Xander made a bit of good work, he uploaded sources with applied modifications by him and plus he broke original formatting in some of files instead of just making diffs. If people want to unify code formatting they should use any of code-styling tools like AStyle but not just doing it with their bare hands, since they make their own modifications be hardly pulled.
