xmp-scrobbler is a Last.fm submission plugin for XMPlay. Since original developer 'yagood' stoped this project, the new guy called 'Xander' brake into to keep project alive. Still he hasn't done any real innovative features, he fixed long-stayed cache corruption problem. Right before i started xmp-scrobbler++ project that will add some new real innovations, but sources will never be published due my decision, yes it will violates original GPL license, but yep, i'm a law pirate bwahaha.
